**J. Taroni 2018**

In this notebook, we will be plotting:

* The number of latent variables for models trained on 1) different biological 
contexts 2) random subsampling (various sample sizes) and the 3) full recount2 
model (MultiPLIER)

* The pathway coverage and proportion of the latent variables associated with
pathways from the same three conditions

## Set up

```{r}
# magrittr pipe
`%>%` <- dplyr::`%>%`
```

We'll use `ggplot2` for plotting.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

#### Custom functions

```{r}
# custom ggplot2 theme
custom_theme <- function() {
  ggplot2::theme_bw() +
    ggplot2::theme(axis.text.x = ggplot2::element_text(angle = 45, 
                                                       hjust = 1),
                   legend.position = "none",
                   plot.title = ggplot2::element_text(hjust = 0.5),
                   axis.title.x = ggplot2::element_blank(),
                   text = ggplot2::element_text(size = 15)) 
}
```

#### Directory setup

```{r}
# plot and result directory setup for this notebook
plot.dir <- file.path("plots", "31")
dir.create(plot.dir, recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
results.dir <- file.path("results", "31")
dir.create(results.dir, recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
```

## Read in data

For both the biological context and sample size evaluations, the results we
will be plotting are from `30-evaluate_sample_size_and_biological_context`.

### Biological context

```{r}
# pathway coverage and proportion of LVs associated with pathways
context.coverage.file <- file.path("results", "30", 
                                   "biological_context_pathway_coverage.tsv")

# we'll want to reorder the biological contexts by sample size
context.levels <- c("blood", "cancer", "tissue", "cell line", "other tissues")

context.coverage.df <- readr::read_tsv(context.coverage.file) %>%
  # clean up the context information for plotting
  dplyr::mutate(biological_context = gsub("_", " ", biological_context)) %>%
  # reorder by the sample size (low -> high)
  dplyr::mutate(biological_context = factor(biological_context,
                                            levels = context.levels))
# number of latent variables
context.num.file <- file.path("results", "30", 
                              "biological_context_number_of_lvs.tsv")
context.num.df <- readr::read_tsv(context.num.file) %>%
  # clean up the context information for plotting
  dplyr::mutate(biological_context = gsub("_", " ", biological_context)) %>%
  # reorder by the sample size (low -> high)
  dplyr::mutate(biological_context = factor(biological_context,
                                            levels = context.levels))
```

### Sample size 

```{r}
# pathway coverage and proportion of LVs associated with pathways
size.coverage.file <- file.path("results", "30", 
                                "subsampled_pathway_coverage.tsv")

# order by sample size
size.levels <- c("500", "1000", "2000", "4000", "8000", "16000", "32000")

# for plotting, we want the sample size as a factor (otherwise it's hard to
# see what is happening on the lower end of things) but to order by the integer
# value
size.coverage.df <- readr::read_tsv(size.coverage.file) %>%
    dplyr::mutate(sample_size = factor(sample_size, levels = size.levels))

# Number of latent variables
size.num.file <- file.path("results", "30",
                           "subsampled_number_of_lvs.tsv")
size.num.df <- readr::read_tsv(size.num.file) %>%
      dplyr::mutate(sample_size = factor(sample_size, levels = size.levels))
```

### MultiPLIER

For the full recount2 bits, we'll use the same values that are in 
`figure_notebooks/subsampling_figures`.
(The full model was trained on ~37K samples, because we subset recount2 to
include only those samples with metadata.)

```{r}
# number of latent variables in the MultiPLIER model
recount2.num.lvs <- 987
# pathway coverage
recount2.coverage <- 0.4187898
# proportion of the latent variables associated with a pathway
recount2.lv.prop <- 0.2016211
```

Make into `data.frames` for plotting purposes. 
We'll always use "condition" as one of the column names (see 
`ThreePlotsWrapper` above).

```{r}
# proportion of LVs associated with pathways
recount2.prop.df <- data.frame(value = recount2.lv.prop,
                               condition = "full recount2")
# pathway coverage
recount2.coverage.df <- data.frame(value = recount2.coverage,
                                   condition = "full recount2")
# number of latent variables
recount2.num.df <- 
  data.frame(number_of_latent_variables = as.integer(recount2.num.lvs),
             condition = "full recount2")
```

## Plotting

### Number of latent variables

```{r}
num.plots <- ThreePlotsWrapper(size.df = size.num.df,
                               context.df = context.num.df,
                               recount2.df = recount2.num.df,
                               y.variable.name = "number_of_latent_variables",
                               y.label = "number of latent variables",
                               y.limits = "c(0, 1000)")
```

Save to file

```{r}
MultiPanelWrapper(size.plot = num.plots$size,
                  context.plot = num.plots$context,
                  recount2.plot = num.plots$recount2,
                  plot.title = "Number of Latent Variables",
                  output.file = file.path(plot.dir, 
                                          "number_of_latent_variables.pdf"))
```

### Pathway coverage

The sample size and biological context `data.frames` contain the information
about pathway coverage _and_ the proportion of LVs associated with a pathway,
so we'll need to filter them to the correct metric.

```{r}
coverage.plots <- 
  ThreePlotsWrapper(size.df = dplyr::filter(size.coverage.df,
                                            metric == "pathway coverage"),
                    context.df = dplyr::filter(context.coverage.df,
                                               metric == "pathway coverage"),
                    recount2.df = recount2.coverage.df,
                    y.variable.name = "value",
                    y.label = "proportion of input pathways")
```

```{r}
MultiPanelWrapper(size.plot = coverage.plots$size,
                  context.plot = coverage.plots$context,
                  recount2.plot = coverage.plots$recount2,
                  plot.title = "Pathway Coverage",
                  output.file = file.path(plot.dir, "pathway_coverage.pdf"))
```

### Latent variables significantly associated with pathways

```{r}
# for line length/style purposes
metric.to.use <- "LV associated with pathways"
prop.plots <- 
  ThreePlotsWrapper(size.df = dplyr::filter(size.coverage.df,
                                            metric == metric.to.use),
                    context.df = dplyr::filter(context.coverage.df,
                                               metric == metric.to.use),
                    recount2.df = recount2.coverage.df,
                    y.variable.name = "value",
                    y.label = "proportion of latent variables")
```

```{r}
MultiPanelWrapper(size.plot = prop.plots$size,
                  context.plot = prop.plots$context,
                  recount2.plot = prop.plots$recount2,
                  plot.title = "LVs significantly associated with pathways",
                  output.file = file.path(plot.dir, "lv_proportion.pdf"))

```

### Following up on the proportion of LVs associated with pathways results

If we look at the `prop.plots`

```{r}
prop.plots$size
prop.plots$context
prop.plots$recount2
```

We can see in the sample size plot that, generally speaking, the larger the 
sample size, the lower the proportion of latent variables that are associated 
with at least one pathway.

`PLIER::PLIER` has a parameter, `frac`, that determines the fraction of latent
variables that meets that criterion. 
(`frac = 0.7` by default in the version of PLIER we have on this Docker 
container; we did not specify `frac`.)

This parameter is used to set `L3`, which is the penalty on `U` that controls
sparsity ([Mao, et al. _bioRxiv_. 2017.](https://doi.org/10.1101/116061)).
Based on my understanding, this controls the proportion of positive entries in 
`U` (i.e., the number of gene sets that an LV has some association with), but 
it _does not_ guarantee that all of these associations will be significant
([Mao, et al. _bioRxiv_. 2017.](https://doi.org/10.1101/116061)) and 
the cutoff we happen to be using (`FDR < 0.05`) is not taken into account. 

For reference, this is the sample size information for these different training
sets:

| Biological condition | Sample size |
|:-----------------------|:----------------|
| blood | 3862 |
| cancer | 8807 |
| tissue | 12396 |
| cell line | 14532 |
| other tissues (not blood) | 32984 | 

Once we take the biological context experiments into account, it gets a bit
more interesting:

* The `blood` training set has ~4000 samples, but models trained on blood have a 
much higher proportion of latent variables significantly associated with 
pathways than the models trained on 4000 randomly selected samples.
We'd expect that there'd be less "technical noise" and more "biological signal"
in the `blood` training set.
It's also likely to be a function of the pathways under consideration. 
Specifically, we supply immune cell-related gene sets to the models, and
we expect `blood` samples to be _particularly_ relevant for those gene sets.
* It looks like the _more latent variables_, the _lower proportion of LVs
significantly associated with a pathway_ based on the sample size results alone.
And it's certainly the case that the more LVs -> the more pathways that are
captured by the model (higher pathway coverage). 
However, `tissue` models have higher number of LVs and more pathway coverage
than `cell line` models but they have approximately the same proportion of LVs
significantly associated with a pathway.
These values are also perhaps a bit lower than we would expect based on sample 
size alone (looking at `16000` from sample size plot).

## Check `U` sparsity

To follow up on the observations above, let's check that, _in practice_, the 
fraction of the LVs that have at least one association with a pathway should be
**~0.7**.
First, removing everything from the workspace.

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

#### Custom functions just for this

```{r}
# this is intended to be used with lists of models output from
# scripts/subsampling_PLIER.R
GetSparsityList <- function(list.of.models) {
  # we assume that the list of models has names
  
  # these sparsity calculations are different from what we've done before
  CheckUSparsity <- function(plier.model) {
    u.matrix <- plier.model$U
    # what proportion of values are positive?
    total.positive <- sum(u.matrix > 0) / (dim(u.matrix)[1] * dim(u.matrix)[2])
    # what proportion of columns have at least 1 positive value (association)?
    col.wise <- sum(apply(u.matrix, 2, function(x) any(x > 0))) / ncol(u.matrix)
    return(list("overall" = total.positive,
                "column_wise" = col.wise))
  }
  
  sparsity.list <- lapply(list.of.models, 
                          function(x) CheckUSparsity(x$PLIER))
  
}

# we'll use this twice -- once for biological context and once for sample size
# we assume that the files.vector is named
GetResults <- function(files.vector) {
  lapply(files.vector, 
         function(x) {
           # for each file, read in the list of models
           model.list <- readRDS(x)
           # get the sparsity list for the current list of models
           GetSparsityList(model.list)
         })
}

```

#### Files

```{r}
models.dir <- "models"
# sample size
size.model.files <- list.files(models.dir, pattern = "subsampled", 
                               full.names = TRUE)
names(size.model.files) <- sub(".RDS", "", sub(".*[_]", "", size.model.files))

# biological context
context.model.files <- list.files(models.dir, pattern = "accessions",
                                  full.names = TRUE)
names(context.model.files) <- 
  stringr::str_match(context.model.files, "recount2_(.*?)_accessions")[, 2]

```

#### Check sparsity

```{r}
size.results <- GetResults(size.model.files)
size.df <- reshape2::melt(size.results)
summary(dplyr::filter(size.df, L3 == "column_wise")$value)
```

```{r}
context.results <- GetResults(context.model.files)
context.df <- reshape2::melt(context.results)
summary(dplyr::filter(context.df, L3 == "column_wise")$value)
```

These results are consistent with our expectations.
